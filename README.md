Proposal: Local AI Smart Assistant for Inclusive Personal Productivity
Overview:
An AI-powered smart assistant designed to run entirely on a local laptop, aimed at assisting users in a wide range of tasks without requiring constant internet connectivity. The assistant supports natural conversations, intelligent search, document analysis, software control, and is adaptable to user-specific interaction rules.

Current Capabilities:

Web Controller: Actively browses the web to fetch the most relevant results. The user can stop the assistant once the desired information is found, or let it continue autonomously.

Document QA with RAG: Analyzes multiple documents using a multi-vector Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) approach to answer questions across PDFs, Word files, etc.

Software Launcher: Opens applications on voice or typed commands.

Conversational AI: Capable of general and assistant-specific dialogue, with dynamic refinement based on user-given rules or tone preferences.

Target Users:

General Users – Professionals, students, or casual users seeking productivity.

Accessibility Focus – Designed to aid people with disabilities such as paralysis, hearing loss, or visual impairments. Speech-driven control allows for hands-free operation, reducing dependency on human aides.

Future Vision:

Security & Misuse Alerts: Send real-time alerts via email or SMS if the system detects unauthorized access or breach attempts.

Lightweight Document Models: Integrate efficient, locally running models for parsing and understanding long or structured documents.

Predictive Analytics Engine: Build a forecasting module for analyzing Excel/CSV files to answer prediction-based queries (e.g., sales forecasts, trend analysis).
